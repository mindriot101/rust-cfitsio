It's very much work in progress so far, and is lacking a lot of features, but the more users the merrier!\n\nWith regards to this specific problem, this is a great idea, thanks! I agree I've had this error with other packages in the past, and the panic messages from `pkg-config` require looking through. I'll see if I can add some error handling (this is rust after all) to the build process.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"b83e8b4dfca7ebd9aba65d02ac0e5e24f95b7802"},"timestamp":1479722671,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg2NjIzMjMxNw=="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d96ccfd5ecd8e935bf999bcd59d18e315a262162"},"timestamp":1479738481,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTk1MjI2NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/mindriot101/rust-fitsio/issues/10#issuecomment-261952265"},"message":"Cheers, thanks for the reply!

Some parts are missing, and others have invalid links. The table of contents is pretty bad.\n\nSome things to change:\n\n- [x] invalid links\n- [x] the table of contents points to the wrong places\n- [x] the table writing seems to be missing\n- [x] the main documentation link in the readme points to an invalid point on docs.rs (they seem to have restructured their url scheme)","files":null}]}

It overloads mathematical operators and provides helper functions for easy array manipulation.\n\nIs it a good idea to integrate `fitsio` with this library?\n\nPros:\n- users of fits files are likely to want to perform simple array manipulations with the resulting data\n\nCons:\n- locks the user into this library specifically\n- if the user wants this library anyway there is hopefully a zero-cost conversion of `Vec` -\u003e `ndarray`","files":null}]}

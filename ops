Currently the build system of the crate is strongly tied to `pkg-config` to find the `cfitsio` library. On Windows under msys2 I cannot convince it to find the correct packages (even though the build script shells out to `pkg-config` which should understand environment variables, it does not work). Under regular powershell/cmd.exe I do not have `pkg-config` installed at all so cannot get it to compile.\n\nI'm interested in knowing more about this problem, and perhaps adding a facility to build on windows easier.","files":null}]}

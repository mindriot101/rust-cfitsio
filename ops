Currently the build system of the crate is strongly tied to `pkg-config` to find the `cfitsio` library. On Windows under msys2 I cannot convince it to find the correct packages (even though the build script shells out to `pkg-config` which should understand environment variables, it does not work). Under regular powershell/cmd.exe I do not have `pkg-config` installed at all so cannot get it to compile.\n\nI'm interested in knowing more about this problem, and perhaps adding a facility to build on windows easier.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"7b5ccb6b566fbaa2ee316c43550df4b52d0d650c"},"timestamp":1586592610,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjM2MjkyMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/mindriot101/rust-fitsio/issues/118#issuecomment-612362921"},"message":"Here's my usage (it's worked so far, also for bigger things like `gtk-rs`):\n\n1) install MSYS2\n\n2) install Rust via `rustup-init.exe` (variant: `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)\n\n3) launch MSYS2 shell via `c:\\msys64\\mingw64.exe`, install development toolchain, install CFITSIO (`mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-cfitsio`)\n\n4) perform `$ export PATH=/c/Users/.../.cargo/bin:$PATH` and proceed to build the project with `cargo`\n\nIf the above doesn't work for you, I could reinstall everything from scratch and note the steps to be sure.","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"7b5ccb6b566fbaa2ee316c43550df4b52d0d650c"},"timestamp":1586592610,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE1OlVzZXJDb250ZW50RWRpdElzc3VlQ29tbWVudEVkaXQ6MzY0NTA4MjQy"},"target":"b4fd1dd1c694985771c41757d02a87fef1e0a45732f605fc81d131c8e3574187","message":"Here's my usage (it's worked so far, also for bigger things like `gtk-rs`):\n\n1) install MSYS2\n\n2) install Rust via `rustup-init.exe` (variant: `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)\n\n3) launch MSYS2 shell via `c:\\msys64\\mingw64.exe`, install development toolchain, install CFITSIO (`mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-cfitsio`)\n\n4) perform `$ export PATH=/c/Users/.../.cargo/bin:$PATH` and proceed to build the project with `cargo` (still in the MSYS2 shell)\n\nIf the above doesn't work for you, I could reinstall everything from scratch and note the steps to be sure.","files":null}]}
